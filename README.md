<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project is intended to help other WordPress developers who are comfortable building custom themes and plugins, working with NodeJS and NPM, as well as some basic command line skills. The idea is to simply run clone the repo and install the dependencies, execute the program in the terminal, and follow the question prompts.

### Prerequisites

As mentioned above, this is a WordPress plugin that will depend on a few other things being in place. Here's a brief rundown of what's required:

* WordPress version 6.3.1 or higher
* PHP version 8.2 or higher
* NodeJS version 18.18 or higher
* Git


### Installation

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to your empty theme folder like so: ```cd wp-content/themes/emptyThemeFolder```.
2. Clone this repository. ```git clone https://github.com/mjones129/themegen.git .```
3. Install deps by running ```npm install```.
4. Execute the ThemeGen file by running ```npm run themegen```.
5. Follow the prompts.
